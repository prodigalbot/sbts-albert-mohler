## Some details about R. Albert Mohler, Jr.

Mohler has been labeled a Christian Nationalist for views he espouses. He himself comes short of claiming the label for himself, and addresses the question of whether he is a Christian Nationalist in [this blog article](https://web.archive.org/web/20221210205443/https://albertmohler.com/2022/12/09/briefing-12-9-22) on albertmohler.com.

[This article](https://currentpub.com/2022/07/10/albert-mohler-christian-nationalist/) by John Fea shares a Mohler quote taken from Mohler's podcast The Briefing. [This article](https://mbcpathway.com/2022/08/31/exclusive-mohler-places-nationalism-in-its-biblical-context/) about Mohler from The Pathway also shares the same quote.

Here is the quote taken from The Pathway:

 > ... nationalism has been given a bad name. Even conservatives who once would identify themselves clearly as nationalist, they’re now running scared from the term and (the left is) routinely speaking of me and others as Christian nationalists, as if we’re supposed to be running from that. And I’m not about to run from that. I’m not about to join their one world order.
